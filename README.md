## Why use GitHub Superfilter?

GitHub's default filter sucks! It only allows to filter by file extension, and it doesn't properly handle files with multiple extensions (like `.test.js`)

On the other hand, GitHub Superfilter is awesome!

ðŸŽ‰ It gives you more control over how you filter your pull requests. You can search for files in a specific folder (`/components/`), or with a specific extension (`.test.js`). You can also filter out files (`!/src/` or `!test`)

ðŸŽ‰ It's lightweight (< 4KB), only runs on github.com, and does not make your browser slower

ðŸŽ‰ It helps you become a better developer by making your life just a little bit easier

## Installation

Download the [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-superfilter/) or the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-superfilter/kfpophkefjclocneelejpjbpkmboepfb).

## Development flow

Clone this repository, and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/TomerRon/github-superfilter
cd github-superfilter
yarn
```

Run the unit tests:

```
yarn test
```

Watch the files:

Start a temporary Firefox session with the add-on installed.
The session uses a new profile that is destroyed after Firefox is closed.

```

Start a temporary Firefox session with the add-on installed.
Use the standard (default) Firefox profile, which shares session/cookies with other windows.
